# beamerntnu2020
Two LaTeX beamer templates for NTNU presentations, as requested by Kolb√∏rn Skarpnes.

## Overview

These beamer templates answer the request for a stand-alone file, easy to use, in line with the official PowerPoint presentation.
As desired, very little knowledge of LaTex is requested, and comments in the .tex files will guide the user.
With this in mind, no theme has been created and minimal instructions are written in each template.

The requested display format for the bilingual template is 16:9.

If you have technical questions, please contact [Mattia Veroni](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/mattia.veroni). 
Do not send such questions to the NTNU Communications Division.


## Installation and usage

Simply copy one .tex file and the two logos in the desired language, then compile the .tex.
For entry-level users, TexStudio is the recommended application (for editing and compiling).


## Contributions and license

The design of these templates is owned by NTNU, and should not be altered 
substantially without checking it with the [Communication Division](https://www.ntnu.no/adm/komm).

Any contribution to improve the code is very welcome.
