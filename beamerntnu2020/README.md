# KolbjørnTemplates
Two LaTeX beamer templates for NTNU presentations requested by Kolbørn Skarpnes.

## Overview

This beamer template answers the request for a stand-alone file, easy to use, which resembled a given PowerPoint presentation.
As desired, very little knowledge of LaTex is requested, and comments in the .tex files will guide the user.
With this in mind, no theme has been created and minimal instructions are written in each template.

The requested display format for the bilingual template is 16:9.

If you have technical questions, please contact [Mattia Veroni](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/mattia.veroni). 
Do not send such questions to the NTNU Communications Division.


## Usage
Simply copy one .tex file and the two logos in the desired language, then compile the .tex.
For entry-level users, TexStudio is the recommended program (for editing and compiling).
